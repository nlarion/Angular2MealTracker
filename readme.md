####This is a website for a fitness club to track meals and number of calories for that meal.
####By: Neil Larion

## Description

###This is a project that allows the user to display information the meals they've eaten and keep track of the calories in each meal. It also meets the following gulp tasks:
* Display of the total number of calories consumed.
* Display the average number of calories consumed.
* View either all foods, only unhealthy foods that are more than 300 calories, or only healthy foods that are less than 300 calories.
* Edit meals in the app.
* Add meals into the app.

#### This is an app built with the Angular 2 framework using TypeScript

This project was developed during a "Code Review" session at Epicodus, which is a solo project designed to test our knowledge of the materials learned over the previous week's study. It's an honor to be apart of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing.
